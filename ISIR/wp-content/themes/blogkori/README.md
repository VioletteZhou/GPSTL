## Developers note

Hey thanks for downloading this theme and actually opening and reading this "README" file. This theme was inspired from the Thesis Theme from DIYthemes. I created this same design in that premium thesis theme. Then when it was time for me to create a WordPress theme, I took this design as an inspiration. All the typography, line borders and even the curly braces next to the {1 comment} was inspired from the original thesis 1.8

This is my first theme, so it does not have any extra features. As I learn more and more about WordPress theme development, I will make more themes with cool features. If you love my theme and use it on your site, please send me an email with your site address and I will be happy to check it out.

## Theme Limitations

**Theme menu does not show logo when viewed from mobile devices.**
It will show the website name in place of the logo. Will work on this in the future releases.

**Theme menu has 1 level of drop down, and you have to click on**
the menu to show the drop down menu. So when setting up a menu
please add just one level of drop down, thanks.
