Hey thanks for downloading this theme and actually opening and 
reading this "README" file. This theme was inspired from the 
Thesis Theme from DIYthemes. I created this same design in that 
premium thesis theme. Then when it was time for me to create a 
WordPress theme, I took this design as an inspiration. All the 
typography, line borders and even the curly braces next to the 
{1 comment} was inspired from the original thesis 1.8 

This is my first theme, so it does not have any extra features. 
As I learn more and more about WordPress theme development, 
I will make more themes with cool features. If you love my theme 
and use it on your site, please send me an email with your site 
address and I will be happy to check it out.
